# MIPS
Implementation of pipelined 32-bit RISC MIPS processor using Verilog HDL
#MIPS32 is a variant of the Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) architecture,
which executes instructions using a five-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) with latches to ensure data
flow between stages.
#Use a written testbench to perform various algebric operations and timing diagrams were used to confirm
successful outcomes.
